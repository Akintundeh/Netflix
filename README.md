📊 Portfolio Project: Netflix Dashboard (1960–2021) 🎬

I recently built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Netflix’s content catalog spanning from 1960 to 2021.

The dashboard explores:
✅ Movies vs TV Shows distribution
✅ Content growth over time (when Netflix ramped up production)
✅ Top country contributing to Netflix’s library
✅ Ratings analysis (audience targeting strategies)

🔍 Business Relevance:
This analysis highlights how Netflix evolved from primarily movies to a global TV show powerhouse, with a strong push into international and adult-rated content post-2015.

For me, this project was not only about data visualization, but also about showcasing:
 • Power BI skills (slicers, filters, KPIs)
 • Data storytelling for business contexts
 • Turning raw data into insights that could inform media strategy
